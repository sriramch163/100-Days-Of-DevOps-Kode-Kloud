# Day 76 - Jenkins Project Security

## 🎯 Task Objective

The objective of this task is to configure job-level access control in Jenkins by granting appropriate permissions to newly onboarded developers. This involves enabling permission inheritance from the parent ACL for an existing Jenkins job and assigning role-specific privileges to designated users. The goal is to ensure secure, controlled, and role-aligned access to the Packages job in accordance with the development team's requirements, while adhering to Jenkins best practices for authorization management.
