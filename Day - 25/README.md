# Day 25 - Git Merge Branches

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The objective of this task is to practice essential Git branching and merging operations within a real project repository. You will create a new branch from the master branch, add a new file to this branch, commit the changes, and merge them back into master. Finally, you will push updates from both branches to the remote repository. This ensures proper version control workflow, branch isolation, and integration of changes in a collaborative DevOps environment.
